# Linguistic data sets in Portuguese via cooperation with communities
**[work in progress] Permanent project to coordinate the creation and update
linguistic data sets (such as those that can be used to detect
discrimination and hate speech) preferably validated by people
representatives of affected groups or subject matter experts. Dedicated to
public domain.**

## Role of Etica.AI

Unlike [EticaAI/linguistic-datasets-portuguese](https://github.com/EticaAI/linguistic-datasets-portuguese)
(which is a list for different data sets
in Portuguese from different sources) this repository contains
reference for the data sets themselves where Etica.AI serves as
organization to allow collaboration on an ongoing basis.

Linguistic datasets in Portuguese are rare, not very complete and, when they exist,
they are often on a restricted use license. The importance of our
work here, to even release commercial use, has the potential to help
in automations (such as detection of verbal attacks).
