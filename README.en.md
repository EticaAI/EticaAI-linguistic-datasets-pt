# EticaAI Linguistic Datasets PT
** [public draft Linguistic data sets for Portuguese
with flexible licenses. **

(Note: this document has sample text in Portuguese to test the
`bin / translate-readme` tool.)

The aim of this project, inspired by the spirit of [FOSS] (https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_livre_e_de_c%C3%B3digo_aberto),
is to list sources of knowledge representations that, depending on the language
and local cultures, cannot be imported. They require special attention,
multidisciplinary character, and that ideally _ should already be ready and
acceptably validated_: when they do not exist, at best, they can
force them to be made by a non-specialist and impair quality, and at worst, until
prevent the production of innovative technologies.
