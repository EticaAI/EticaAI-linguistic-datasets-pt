# Linguistic data sets in Portuguese via cooperation with communities

> Note: as described on [issues#2](https://github.com/EticaAI/EticaAI-linguistic-datasets-pt/issues/2)
  this file, README.en.md, is result of machine translation. No attempt is
  made to correct translation errors, in order to allow future volunteers to
  remain involved because they do not know English.

**[work in progress] Permanent project to coordinate the creation and update
linguistic data sets (such as those that can be used to detect
discrimination and hate speech) preferably validated by people
representatives of affected groups or subject matter experts. Dedicated to
public domain.**

## Data set

> NOTE: at the moment, 2020-12-01, the content made available here is not
  ready for end use and primarily serves to test strategies for how to
  collect and HXL hashtags to use to classify information.

## Groups involved

### Role of Etica.AI

Unlike [EticaAI/linguistic-datasets-portuguese](https://github.com/EticaAI/linguistic-datasets-portuguese)
(which is a list for different data sets
in Portuguese from different sources) this repository contains
reference for the data sets themselves where Etica.AI serves as
organization to allow collaboration on an ongoing basis.

Linguistic datasets in Portuguese are rare, not very complete and, when they exist,
often are on restricted use license or depend on access to APIs
proprietary, even if free. The importance of our work here, from
even freeing commercial use, has the potential to help with automation (such as
detection of verbal attacks).

### Role of HXL-CPLP

Not only HXL (The Humanitarian eXchange Language) is our main form
data storage in this project, as there is an exchange of aids, via
with people who already work in the information technology area of
international humanitarian organizations.

Your feedback on how to improve collaboration processes can impact even
even outside Portuguese-speaking countries. You, whether you are a developer of
software to even a typically affected community member (even without knowing
English or without having affinity with computers) if you are interested we can
help you prepare beyond your home country.

### Role of people in the community

For the purposes of this project, both Etica.AI and HXL-CPLP people should
be seen as facilitators, not creators. Community people
affected, even if they are not specialists with an academic doctorate (but who,
still, has the courage to help assemble initial content that can be
revised in the future) are the main enablers of every idea.

One of the implications of data sets dedicated to the public domain is that the
final result may not contain names of individuals (not even Etica.AI /
HXL-CPLP) as much as possible we will see alternative ways of valuing in
special contribution from people who help to coordinate / revalidate work of
others or who created meaningful initial content even if you prefer
not to assume authorship of your contributions for fear of retaliation.
